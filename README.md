# Exoplanet detection

This repo contains the 7.5 ECTS project I did on the detection of Exoplanets using machine learning and the Doppler method.

# Intro
In this project, I determined whether the star HC34411 was orbited by an exoplanet using the Doppler method, the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, and the machine learning clustering algorithm DBSCAN.

We often think of the center of our solar system to be the center of the Sun, a point that all the planets orbit. In actuality, all the planets as well as the Sun orbit the collective center of mass of all objects in the solar system. When we detect a distant star we can then determine if any exoplanets are displacing the common center of mass, causing the star to orbit.
